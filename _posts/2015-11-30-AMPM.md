excerpt: "AM PM was a group project I completed in December 2015. The purpose of the project was to create a site for a fake restaurant using mostly Javascript. It was front-end heavy and there were a lot of form validations to do in JS. While there is a lot I would change about it now, I enjoy looking back to see what my old projects were all about. Find it on github <a href='https://www.github.com/ndoak'>here</a>!"
