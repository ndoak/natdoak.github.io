excerpt: "Crosses and circles is a JavaScript only take on the classic tic tac toe game. It was a lot of fun to be able to work on a project that was exclusively JavaScript based. I definitely want to do more projects like this. Check it out on github <a href='https://github.com/ndoak/Crosses-and-Circles'>here</a>!"
